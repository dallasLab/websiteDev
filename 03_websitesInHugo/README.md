## Structure 

+ Yet another site-maker, this one with a bit more flexibility, and still can serve sites using blogdown if you want. This one is called Hugo, and it's what I use to make websites for courses I teach https://theoretical-ecology.github.io/ and https://bioldatascience.github.io/, and my lab website https://taddallas.github.io/ . 




Hugo and blogdown 

```{r}
blogdown::new_site(theme = "hugo-apero/hugo-apero",
  format = "toml")
```

Explore the structure. Should look fairly familiar by now, but each theme will have slightly different structure, so that jumping between themes is not impossible by any degree, but can be a small annoyance.
