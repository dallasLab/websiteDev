## Structure 

So you have your beautiful website and now you want to share it with the world. What now? 

There are at least 2 options (there are many more than 2). GitHub pages and Netlify. I will only go over GitHub pages, because Netlify still has your site hosted on GitHub, but does some of the automated building of the website for you. With the creation of GitHub Actions, which allows post-push continuous integration actions (e.g., every time I push to the repo, it runs some code server-side to do a task like create the website and move necessary files to `gh-pages` branch). 

**GitHub pages**
